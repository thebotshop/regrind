    "Original Text: Throw in situations in matches are often just taken for granted and involve little meaningful thought or decision making around them, other than to mark the opposition and prevent ball progression. But these situations can dictate not only who controls possession, but also how and where this possession takes place.In my previous analysis, I discussed the use of pressing traps in order to win the ball back in favourable areas, and pressing from throw-ins is no different. Every throw in situation is an opportunity to press in a favourable area of the pitch, and to shape the next phase of the opposition build-up. In open play pressing, the aim is not simply to stop the opposition progressing, but to also lure the opposition into trying to play through. We then aim to win the ball back in favourable areas that allow for the best offensive opportunities, and so why does this mindset change for throws? Within this article I will discuss various strategies that can be used surrounding defensive throw ins, with the majority focusing on using a defensive throw in as an offensive opportunity. The simplest and most common way teams defend throw ins in football is through man marking Each player usually marks the player closest to him and follows this player strictly. Little rotation in roles occurs, and so the structure of the defending side is completely determined by the offensive movements of the opposition. We can see an example of this simple structure below, in which the defending team create numerical equality with the opposition on the field. Players stay strictly to their player, and so if two opponents rotate into each other’s space, the same player follows their man. As a result, like most man marking systems in football, simple decoy movements, rotations and patterns allow for this system to be manipulated and overcome. Furthermore, numerical equality is only created up until the moment the ball is thrown, when it then becomes a 5v4 in this scenario, with the thrower of course now becoming an extra player. As a result, with a simple pass the opposition can access the free player and look to progress the ball through multiple gaps. The defending team then has to shuffle to close these passing lanes and make the area more compact, while the nearest defender has to react and prepare to press the thrower, while his marker runs behind him. Furthermore, numerical equality is only created up until the moment the ball is thrown, when it then becomes a 5v4 in this scenario, with the thrower of course now becoming an extra player. As a result, with a simple pass the opposition can access the free player and look to progress the ball through multiple gaps. The defending team then has to shuffle to close these passing lanes and make the area more compact, while the nearest defender has to react and prepare to press the thrower, while his marker runs behind him. The attacking team do not throw to the closest available player, and instead space around the thrower well, in order to create more space when they receive the ball next. If the receiver moves in close, they decrease the pressing distance of the opposition player to jump from their marker.The nearest player to the ball moves in to press, but the distance between the receiver and this player gives time to control the ball and play a pass. A 2v1 is now created between the nearest players ex marker, and the thrower, and passing lanes wide and inside are available depending on the reaction and structure of the defence.This numerical disadvantage plus the relative ease to overcome it using intelligent offensive movement are the major downfall of a strictly man orientated system. As a result, there are several other varying ways to defend a throw in situation. Zonal marking from throws relies on each player covering their own zone and occupying any player who enters this zone. Many throw ins rely on space oriented zonal marking initially, in that the team pushes to one compact area to reduce space, which is much more effective if done correctly compared to open play, where it is easier to switch the ball quickly. This means that again regarding rotations and movement, the side becomes less disorganised and is less easily manipulated, with each covering clear zone and passing lanes.We can see below when two players rotate the zonal markers do not move with them, and so are able to track the runners more easily and don’t leave spaces. You may often see markers stand front side to make the zone more compact and leave a player in their cover shadow. If the thrower is capable of a longer throw, this zonal structure can sometimes be bypassed, and so cover is needed around the ball near markers.Again, though in this scenario, the thrower is a free player who can be accessed easily, with the nearest zonal player again jumping to press this player, now making this zonal system ball orientated, with players adjusting their shape to impact the ball. Many teams will employ a mix of both of these strategies depending on the area of the pitch, which is something I will discuss later. We can see an example of a mixed set up in the defensive third here, where some players man mark opponents while others cover a specific zone. Here the right full-back covers the ball near zone which is initially unoccupied. They anticipate a movement from behind, but do not compromise their ball near position to mark the player, instead they wait for them to enter the zone and then stay close, an example of man oriented zonal marking. If the opponent can make intelligent blind side runs or overloads can be created, this can cause problems, and again commonly in this area, you will see a quick 1-2 between thrower and the nearest receiver, where a cross can be played in immediately. It is also worth noting not every team recovers into as compact a shape as this, as we can see in this example from lower league English football.\n
    Summarized: It is worth noting that in many of these examples of ‘jumps’, the movements have been ball or man orientated, similar to the variants in counter-pressing. The moment the ball is thrown acts as the trigger for the defensive movement, the same way that losing the ball does. From throws, the press is usually man/access orientated (e.g. FC Midtjylland and RB Leipzig examples), with players jumping to mark the nearest player, but as the Dortmund example shows it can also be space orientated, with certain areas deliberately made tighter once the ball is played. Passing lane orientated pressing is rare from throws, as teams look to reduce the space immediately to prevent a switch in play, and do not take the risk of using interceptions to win the ball.\n\n"
